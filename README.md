# Lung-Cancer-Recognition-Using-CT-Scan-with-NCA-XGBoosting-KNN

A type of malignancy known as lung cancer is the most common type of malignancy among men, and it is the third most common type of malignancy among women. The early detection of lung cancer is critical to reducing the impact of the disease's death rate throughout the world. Because the symptoms of lung cancer are not recognized until the disease has progressed to an advanced stage, it is critical to predicting the disease at an earlier stage using any medical imaging techniques available. The goal of this work is to propose a classification methodology for lung cancer that can be used automatically at the onset of the disease. The computed tomography (CT) imaging modality of the lungs is used for the examination, and the NCA-XGBoosting & KNN are used for the classification task in this work. Following the pre-processing of the input lung images, we used the VGG19 classifier, which uses an adaptive boosting method based on the pretrained method to identify the lung images.
